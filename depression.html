        About me :-
    </h3>
    <p>
        Hey, Namaste this is <strong>Brijesh Saayi</strong>, Basically I'm a techie who explores the new thing's into technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        I read books a lot mainly the books of <strong>Ayn Rand</strong> & <strong>Joseph Murphy</strong>. And Follow there philosophies a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        Studying about human behaviour & mental health are my favourite things to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        That keen towards knowing about human behaviour & the mental helath made me write this blog. 
    </p>
    <h4>
        1. Depression
    </h4>
    <p>
        Firstly the reason for writing this topic is I have recently seen many people suffering from this issue with many reasons & that may be
        personal problems, professional problmes or other any sort of issues.
    </p>
    <p>
        So coming to our main topic i.e <strong>depression</strong>. If we observe about the issue and refering the above line's there is common
        thing about depression that people are having any issue's or problem's. I mean that there first & for-most thing which is leading them to
        the main problem i.e <strong>"depression"</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generally what a human does when they have a problem ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    </p>
    <p>
        üëâ &nbsp; &nbsp; Worrying
    </p>
    <p>
    &
    </p>
    <p>
        üëâ &nbsp; &nbsp; Thinking
    </p>
    <p>
        First we will discuss about <strong>"worrying"</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many people do this i.e <strong>worrying</strong>. Because basic human mentality is like this that they worry when they have any sort of
        problem in there life.
    </p>
    <p>
        What happen's when you worry ?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Physically you become weak.</strong> That include's human walking style to how they talk normally. Everyone with you will observe that you are
        your in a state worrying.
    </p>
    <p>
        Which leads to release of various harmful chemical's in your body.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Which you will not observe now. You will get to know the side effect's of this in future.)
    </p>
    <p>
        nextly
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Mentally you become weak.</strong> That include's of being dull i.e non-active and all.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Which leads to suicidal thoughts. Which I have observed in many teenager's & adult's )
    </p>
    <p>
        And, Now discussing about <strong>"thinking"</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many people don't do this i.e <strong>"thinking"</strong>. That's because many of the human's are habituated to get concern from another human
        and Therefore they are loosing the ability of thinking & rate of worrying is increased in the human mentality.
    </p>
    <p>
        What happen's when you think ?
    </p>
    <p>
        Thinking leads you to the solution of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
        (Which exactly not means to the solution of the problem, Which means that it increase's the capacity and boost's up your
        confidence to face the problem.)
    </p>
    <p>
        nextly
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Mentally you become strong.</strong> That include's your focus on capability of how your facing the problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        (This is how you become strong in your life. By which you can face any sort of problem's & issue's in your life.)
    </p>
    <h5>
        Never worry for having problems in your life , Think and face them which leads you to the solution of the problem.
