    <h4>2. Life v/s Career.</h4>
    <p>What's life & What's career <br> <br> How are you messing up the both concepts in your real practical life.</p>
    <h4>1. LIFE</h4>
    <p>Reason for writing this blog is Many people say what are you doing in life ?</p>
    <p>We give like answer's related to career likely <br> ðŸ‘‡ </p>
    <p> <b>" I'm into coding field "</b> </p>
    <p> <b>" I'm into banking field "</b> </p>
    <p> <b>" I'm doing business and all.....! "</b> </p>
    <p>In the above all answers your saying about career not about your life.</p>
    <p>So, whats <b>Life</b> & whats <b>Career</b> ?.</p>
    <p>So, lets discuss whats <b>life</b> in the further paragraphs.</p>
    <p>Life contains everything i.e from small <b>ant</b> big gaint <b>elephant</b>. And thats what many people say <b>enjoy</b> life <b>discover</b> new things in life.</p>
    <p>So, in the topic of life we get all the <b>cosmos</b>.</p>

    <p>So why do we say <b>My life , There life , His life , Her life</b> which includes one's self involving. That is because we have taken a specific part of life. <i>( Now about life with the definations of life which we learnt in the above topics. )</i></p>
    <p>Now, we see the different percpections of thinkng about <b>LIFE</b>.</p>
    <p>So , Why the hell we mix up concepts of <b>life</b> and <b>career</b> and " Whats career ? " </p>
    <p><hr></p>
    <h4>2. Career</h4>
    <p>It's basically an <b>occupation</b> undertaken for a significant period of a person's life and with opportunities for progress</p>
    <p>So by seeing the above defination which is so <b>complex</b>. We can get to know that it belongs the main to category of <b>"OCCUPATION"</b>.</p>
    <img class="career" src="https://study.com/cimages/videopreview/videopreview-full/5d68vjdolg.jpg">
    <p>Doing something which relates to your occupation come's under career aspect's.</p>
    <p><b>Why the hell we mix up this two aspects (LIfe and career) ?</b></p>
    <img class="confuse" src="https://ak.picdn.net/shutterstock/videos/724090/thumb/1.jpg">
    <p>Beacuse many of us stopped or forgot to live the life. Forgot the art of observing i.e whats going on in there surroundings</p>
    <p>Here surroundings means nature and beauty of the environment and whats going on in the life. And also the <b>current affairs</b> by which everyone are aware of by there social networking platforms i.e <b>Facebook , Twitter , Instagram etc...</b></p>
    <p>So people you are so busy in your career aspect that you forgot how to live life.</p>
    <h5>So, to sum up this whole topic with one small formula is just simple. <br>ðŸ‘‡</h5>
    <h5>Life â‰  Career </h5>
