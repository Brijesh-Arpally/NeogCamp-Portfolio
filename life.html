    <h4>2. Life v/s Carrer.</h4>
    <p>What's life & What's carrer <br> <br> How are you messing up the both concepts in your real practical life.</p>
    <p>Reason for writing this blog is Many people say what are you doing in life ?</p>
    <p>We give like answer's related to carrer likely <br> ðŸ‘‡ </p>
    <p> <b>" I'm into coding field "</b> </p>
    <p> <b>" I'm into banking field "</b> </p>
    <p> <b>" I'm doing business and all.....! "</b> </p>
    <p>In the above all answers your saying about carrer not about your life.</p>
    <p>So, whats <b>Life</b> & whats <b>Carrer</b> ?.</p>
    <p>So, lets discuss whats <b>life</b> in the further paragraphs.</p>
    <p>Life contains everything i.e from small <b>ant</b> big gaint <b>elephant</b>. And thats what many people say <b>enjoy</b> life <b>discover</b> new things in life.</p>

    <p>So why do we say <b>My life , There life , His life , Her life</b> which includes one's self involving. That is because we have taken a specific part of life. <i>( Now about life with the definations of life which we learnt in the above topics. )</i></p>
    <p>Now, we see the different percpections of thinkng about <b>LIFE</b>.</p>
    <p>So , Why the hell we mix up concepts of <b>life</b> and <b>carrer</b> and " Whats carrer ? " </p>
